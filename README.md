##Code Redux (2)

This is an updated version of an app I created 3 years ago with other students of Dev Bootcamp.

It's a relatively simple CRUD rails app hosted on heroku. (coderedux2.herokuapp.com)

###Notable Functionality
- use of Ace standalone code editor library in js
- automatic emails to users using ActionMailer
- github api access w/ js library (import repo page or gist into Ace)
- pagination w/ kaminari gem
- ajax-driven voting/comments


###Other implementation
- user authentication w/ devise
- styling w/ bootstrap
